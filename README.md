asteroids is a broken project
asteroids2 is the one i am updating

The project is a 3D asteroids game. It involves shooting asteroids in 3D

The project contains complicated maths which involves matrices and vectors. These are used for my rendering engine and my seperating axis theorem implementation (incomplete)
seperating axis theorem and rendering is done on the GPU whereas perlin noise is done on the CPU.
The code structure involves the use of abstract classes and interfaces and asteroids are dynamically spawned in.
